## Project Description ##
LocalWiki is a wiki for culminating any and all knowledge on assorted topics. Users will be able to add their browse existing pages, search all of the pages, add their own pages, and edit existing pages. Our wiki will be available over a network connection and all of the data will be stored locally on the server. When first connecting to our server, clients will be asked a nickname to go by, and we may add in accounts in later versions.
