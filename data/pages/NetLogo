NetLogo was designed, by Uri Wilensky, in the spirit of the Logo programming language, to be "low threshold and no ceiling". It teaches programming concepts using agents in the form of turtles, patches, links and the observer.[1] NetLogo was designed for multiple audiences in mind, in particular: teaching children in the education community, and for domain experts without a programming background to model related phenomena.[2] Many scientific articles have been published using NetLogo.[3]

The NetLogo environment enables exploration of emergent phenomena. It comes with an extensive models library including models in a variety of domains, such as economics, biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, system dynamics.[4] NetLogo allows exploration by modifying switches, sliders, choosers, inputs, and other interface elements.[5] Beyond exploration, NetLogo allows authoring of new models and modification of existing models.

NetLogo is open source and freely available from the NetLogo website.[6] It is in use in a wide variety of educational contexts from elementary school to graduate school.[7][8][9][10] Many teachers make use of NetLogo in their curricula.[11][12]

NetLogo was designed and authored by Uri Wilensky,[13] director of Northwestern University's Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling.[14]
